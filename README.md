# R-Programming-2
This repository demonstrates key R programming concepts. It includes examples of variables (numeric, character, logical, integer), vectors, lists, and matrices with random values. Key functions like length() and control structures such as for and while loops are also utilized. Additionally, Part 2 explores the mtcars dataset for data analysis.
